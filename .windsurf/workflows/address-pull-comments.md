# Pull Comment Workflow

## Overview
This workflow automates the process of addressing comments on pull requests for the PDF Q&A application. It helps streamline the review process, categorize feedback, and ensure that all comments are properly addressed before merging.

## Triggers
- New comment added to a pull request
- Comment edited on a pull request
- Pull request review submitted

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Comment Classification

```yaml
name: classify-comments
description: Categorize incoming pull request comments by type
inputs:
  comment_text:
    description: The text content of the comment
    required: true
outputs:
  category:
    description: The classified category of the comment
    values: [code-fix, enhancement, question, documentation, test, design, other]
  priority:
    description: The priority level of the comment
    values: [high, medium, low]
  requires_action:
    description: Whether the comment requires action before merging
    type: boolean
```

### 2. Task Creation

```yaml
name: create-tasks
description: Create actionable tasks from pull request comments
inputs:
  comment_id:
    description: The ID of the comment
    required: true
  category:
    description: The category of the comment
    required: true
  priority:
    description: The priority level of the task
    required: true
outputs:
  task_id:
    description: The ID of the created task
  assigned_to:
    description: The user assigned to the task
```

### 3. Comment Response

```yaml
name: respond-to-comment
description: Generate and post appropriate responses to pull request comments
inputs:
  comment_id:
    description: The ID of the comment to respond to
    required: true
  category:

    required: true
  task_id:
    description: The ID of the associated task

outputs:
  response_id:
    description: The ID of the posted response
```

### 4. Progress Tracking

```yaml
name: track-comment-resolution
description: Track the progress of addressing pull request comments
inputs:
  pull_request_id:
    description: The ID of the pull request
    required: true
outputs:
  total_comments:
    description: Total number of comments on the pull request
    type: number
  resolved_comments:
    description: Number of resolved comments
    type: number
  pending_comments:
    description: Number of pending comments
    type: number
  completion_percentage:
    description: Percentage of comments that have been resolved
    type: number
```

## Integration Points

### GitHub Integration
- Automatically labels pull requests based on comment categories
- Updates pull request status based on comment resolution progress
- Prevents merging until all high-priority comments are addressed

### Notification System
- Sends notifications to relevant team members when new comments are added
- Provides daily summaries of pending comments
- Alerts on stale comments that haven't been addressed

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Code Fix Comment

When a reviewer comments:
```
Fix: The PDF extraction logic doesn't handle encrypted PDFs correctly.
```

The workflow will:
1. Classify as "code-fix" with "high" priority
2. Create a task assigned to the PR author
3. Add a "needs-fix" label to the PR
4. Prevent merging until resolved

### Example 2: Enhancement Suggestion

When a reviewer comments:
```
Suggestion: Consider adding a progress bar during PDF upload for better UX.
```

The workflow will:
1. Classify as "enhancement" with "medium" priority
2. Create a task in the backlog
3. Add an "enhancement" label to the PR
4. Allow merging (non-blocking)

## Customization

Team members can customize this workflow by:
1. Editing the comment classification rules
2. Adjusting priority levels for different comment types
3. Modifying the automatic assignment logic
4. Changing notification preferences

## Maintenance

This workflow should be reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure it remains aligned with the team's evolving processes and needs.
