# Addressing Pull Request Comments

This workflow provides a step-by-step guide for handling comments on pull requests for the PDF Q&A application.

## Step 1: Review all comments

1. Open the pull request on GitHub
2. Read through all comments to understand the feedback
3. Group comments by type:
   - Code bugs/issues
   - Performance improvements
   - Style/formatting
   - Documentation needs

## Step 2: Create a checklist

1. Create a checklist of all items that need to be addressed
2. Prioritize the list (critical bugs first, style issues last)
3. Estimate time needed for each item

## Step 3: Address code issues

1. Check out the branch locally
   ```bash
   git checkout pdf-extraction-improvements
   ```

2. Make necessary code changes for each item on your checklist
   ```bash
   # Example: Improving PDF text extraction
   # Edit the extract_text_from_pdf function to handle errors better
   ```

3. Test your changes thoroughly
   ```bash
   # Run the application and test with various PDFs
   python upload_and_extract.py
   ```

## Step 4: Commit changes with clear messages

1. Stage your changes
   ```bash
   git add upload_and_extract.py
   ```

2. Create a descriptive commit message
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix PDF extraction to handle encrypted documents as requested in PR comments"
   ```

## Step 5: Push changes to GitHub

1. Push your changes to the branch
   ```bash
   git push origin pdf-extraction-improvements
   ```

## Step 6: Respond to comments

1. Reply to each comment on GitHub explaining how you addressed it
2. Use code snippets or screenshots where helpful
3. Mark comments as resolved when appropriate

## Step 7: Request re-review

1. Once all comments are addressed, request a re-review from the original reviewers
2. Summarize all the changes you made in a comment

## Tips for effective PR comment handling

- Don't be defensive about feedback - it's about improving the code, not criticizing you
- Ask clarifying questions if a comment is unclear
- Group related changes in logical commits
- Test thoroughly before pushing fixes
- Thank reviewers for their input
